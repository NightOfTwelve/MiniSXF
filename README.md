MiniSXF - Copyright (c) 2012-2013 - by Mario Gomez - version 0.1.1

Introduction
---------------------
MiniSXF is a sightly modified version of MiniZip 1.1  that is built
from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )

Original note: When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result
into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.
All possible work was done for compatibility.

Note: Appears that fopen in cygwin already supports large files, so 
there is no needed to call fopen64.

Background
---------------------
There isn't a simple way to generate self extracting files on linux
web servers that can be run on Windows systems without executing external
commands.

Many hosting services doesn't allow you to run external commands, so I
need a solution that allows me to generate a self extracting file
programmaticaly without executing any externals commands in PHP.

This simple executable just try to find the data appended to itself and
extract the zipfile using the MiniZip routines.

This is a really "beta experimental version". It could have a lot of
bugs because I tried to remove all the code to make it compile under
cygwin.

The original source code can be found on:

http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html

Compiling (On Windows)
---------------------------------------

1-You will need to install CygWIN with gcc, make and zlib.

2-Modify the paths to zlib inside the Makefile and run:

  "make"

3-Check the file size with "ls -al MiniSXF.exe" and modify
the following line on minisxf.c
  const size_t payload = <<New file size here>>;

4-Run "make clean" and "make" again.

5-Check if file size is the same if not repeat from 3.

Note: It's possible that this will run on linux without
major modifications on the source code but I haven't tried
yet.

Usage (On unix systems)
---------------------------------------

To generate a self extracting file in command line just
copy the compiled executable "MiniSXF.exe" and a zipfile
with the contents. Then merge both files with the following command:

  cat MiniSXF.exe payload.zip > generated.exe

On Windows just run the generated executable.

Usage (On Windows)
---------------------------------------

Note: Tested on Windows 7 64 bits.

If you try to Run the compiled executable it's going to warn
you that there is no payload in the file and it's going to exit.

generated.exe : Extracts the contents of the payload on the current
directory.

generated.exe -v : Shows version number and copyright info.

generated.exe -l : List the contents of the file.

Changes from MiniSXF 0.1 to  MiniSXF 0.1.1
---------------------------------------

* Code now compiles with the -mno-cygwin option on windows and
 runs without cygwin.
* A lot of code cleanup, now a lot more easy to read.
* README updated with usage options.

 * To be able to use BZip compression method in zip64.c or unzip64.c the BZIP2 lib is needed and HAVE_BZIP2 need to be defined.
